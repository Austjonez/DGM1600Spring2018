public class conventionsandsyntax : MonoBehaviour {

	// I think i have a grasp of what all of this means, so hear goes nothing. 
	// The script itself is a box. The box is the class with a name, in this case, conventionandsyntax
	// If the box is public, its more of a clear box that others can see into
	// If its private, its more of a cardboard box.
	// Inside of this box, there are other boxes that are functions.
	// These other boxes do things.
	// You can call one of these mini boxes to work inside another mini box 
	// Void is a function that returns nothing, it still does work, it just gives you nothing
	// Start means that once you start, it starts the function
	// Printing just prints to the console
